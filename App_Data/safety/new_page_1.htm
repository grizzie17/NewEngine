						<li><span class="normal"><b>Assume you’re invisible</b><br>Because to a lot of drivers, you are. Never make a move 
					based on the assumption that another driver sees you, even 
					if you’ve just made eye contact. Bikes don’t always register 
					in the four-wheel mind.</span> </li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Get your mind right in the 
					driveway</b><br>Most accidents happen during the first 15 minutes of a ride, 
					below 40 mph, near an intersection or driveway. Yes, that 
					could be your driveway.</span> </li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Dress for the crash, not the 
					pool or the prom</b><br>Sure, Joaquin’s Fish Tacos is a 5-minute trip, but nobody 
					plans to eat pavement. Modern mesh gear means 100-degree 
					heat is no excuse for a T-shirt and board shorts.</span> 
						</li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Wear good gear</b><br>Wear stuff that fits you and the weather. If you’re too hot 
					or too cold or fighting with a jacket that binds across the 
					shoulders, you’re dangerous. It’s that simple.</span> </li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Hope for the best, prepare for 
					the worst</b><br>Assume that car across the intersection will turn across 
					your bow when the light goes green, with or without a turn 
					signal.</span> </li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Left-turning cars remain a 
					leading killer of motorcyclists</b><br>Don’t assume someone will wait for you to dart through the 
					intersection. They’re trying to beat the light, too. </span>
						</li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Think before you act</b><br>Careful whipping around that Camry going 7 mph in a 25-mph 
					zone or you could end up with your head in the driver’s side 
					door when he turns into the driveway right in front of you.</span> 
						</li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Be patient</b><br>Always take another second or three before you pull out to 
					pass, ride away from a curb or into freeway traffic from an 
					on-ramp. It's what you <i>don't</i> see that gets you. That 
					extra look could save your butt.</span> </li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Be considerate</b><br>The consequences of strafing the jerk du jour or cutting him 
					off start out bad and get worse. Pretend it was your grandma 
					and think again.</span> </li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Leave your ego at home</b><br>The only people who really care if you were faster on the 
					freeway will be the officer and the judge.</span> </li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Emotions in check?</b><br>To paraphrase Mr. Ice Cube, chickity-check yoself before you 
					wreck yoself. Emotions are as powerful as any drug, so take 
					inventory every time you saddle up. If you’re mad, sad, 
					exhausted or anxious, stay put.</span> </li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Mind the gap</b><br>Remember Driver’s Ed? One second’s worth of distance per 10 
					mph is the old rule of thumb. Better still, scan the next 12 
					seconds ahead for potential trouble.</span> </li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Raise your gaze</b><br>It’s too late to do anything about the 20 feet immediately 
					in front of your fender, so scan the road far enough ahead 
					to see trouble and change trajectory.</span> </li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Mirrors only show you part of 
					the picture</b><br>Never change direction without turning your head to make 
					sure the coast really is clear.</span> </li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Check your mirrors</b><br>Do it every time you change lanes, slow down or stop. Be 
					ready to move if another vehicle is about to occupy the 
					space you’d planned to use.</span> </li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Keep your eyes moving</b><br>Traffic is always shifting, so keep scanning for potential 
					trouble. Don’t lock your eyes on any one thing for too long 
					unless you’re actually dealing with trouble.</span> </li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Tune your peripheral vision</b><br>Pick a point near the center of that wall over there. Now 
					scan as far as you can by moving your attention, not your 
					gaze. The more you can see without turning your head, the 
					sooner you can react to trouble.</span> </li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Look where you want to go</b><br>Use the miracle of target fixation to your advantage. The 
					motorcycle goes where you look, so focus on the solution 
					instead of the problem.</span> </li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Pay attention</b><br>Yes, there is a half-naked girl on the billboard. That shock 
					does feels squishy. Meanwhile, you could be drifting toward 
					Big Trouble. Focus.</span> </li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Watch your closing speed</b><br>Passing cars at twice their speed or changing lanes to shoot 
					past a row of stopped cars is just asking for trouble.
						</span></li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Beware the verge and the 
					merge</b><br>A lot of nasty surprises end up on the sides of the road: 
					empty McDonald’s bags, nails, TV antennas, ladders, you name 
					it. Watch for potentially troublesome debris on both sides 
					of the road.</span> </li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Beware of cars running 
					traffic lights</b><br>The first few seconds after a signal light changes are the 
					most perilous. Look both ways before barging into an 
					intersection.</span> </li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Don’t get in an intersection 
					rut</b><br>Watch for a two-way stop after a string of four-way 
					intersections. If you expect cross-traffic to stop, there 
					could be a painful surprise when it doesn’t.</span> </li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Intersections are scary, so 
					hedge your bets</b><br>Put another vehicle between your bike and the possibility of 
					someone running the stop sign/red light on your right and 
					you cut your chances of getting nailed in half.</span> </li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Come to a full stop at that 
					next stop sign</b><br>Put a foot down. Look again. Anything less forces a snap 
					decision with no time to spot potential trouble.</span> 
						</li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Excessive entrance speed 
					hurts</b><br>It’s the leading cause of single-bike accidents on twisty 
					roads and racetracks. In Slow, Out Fast is the old adage, 
					and it still works. Dialing up corner speed is safer than 
					scrubbing it off.</span> </li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Keep the front brake 
					covered—always</b><br>Save a single second of reaction time at 60 mph and you can 
					stop 88 feet shorter. Think about that.</span> </li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Learn to use both brakes</b><br>The front does most of your stopping, but a little rear 
					brake on corner entry can calm a nervous chassis.</span> 
						</li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Take the panic out of panic 
					stops</b><br>Develop an intimate relationship with your front brake. Seek 
					out some safe, open pavement. Starting slowly, find that 
					fine line between maximum braking and a locked wheel, and 
					then do it again, and again.</span> </li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Never dive into a gap in 
					stalled traffic</b><br>Cars may have stopped for a reason, and you may not be able 
					to see why until it’s too late to do anything about it.</span> 
						</li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Don’t saddle up more than you 
					can handle</b><br>If you weigh 95 pounds, avoid that 795-pound cruiser. If 
					you’re 5-foot-5, forget those towering adventure-tourers.</span> 
						</li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Watch for car doors opening in 
					traffic</b><br>And smacking a car that’s swerving around some goofball’s 
					open door is just as painful.</span> </li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Master the slow U-turn</b><br>Practice. Park your butt on the outside edge of the seat and 
					lean the bike into the turn, using your body as a 
					counterweight as you pivot around the rear wheel.</span> 
						</li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Be smooth at low speeds</b><br>Take some angst out, especially of slow-speed maneuvers, 
					with a bit of rear brake. It adds a welcome bit of stability 
					by minimizing unwelcome weight transfer and potentially 
					bothersome driveline lash.</span> </li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Stay in your comfort zone 
					when you’re with a group</b><br>Riding over your head is a good way to end up in the ditch. 
					Any bunch worth riding with will have a rendezvous point 
					where you’ll be able to link up again. </span></li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Give your eyes some time to 
					adjust</b><br>A minute or two of low light heading from a well-lighted 
					garage onto dark streets is a good thing. Otherwise, you’re 
					essentially flying blind for the first mile or so.</span> 
						</li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Who put a stop sign at the 
					top of this hill?</b><br>Don’t panic. Use the rear brake to keep from rolling back 
					down. Use Mr. Throttle and Mr. Clutch normally—and 
					smoothly—to pull away.</span> </li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>If it looks slippery, assume 
					it is</b><br>A patch of suspicious pavement could be just about anything. 
					Butter Flavor Crisco? Gravel? Mobil 1? Or maybe it’s 
					nothing. Better to slow down for nothing than go on your 
					head.</span> </li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Bang! A blowout! Now what?</b><br>No sudden moves. The motorcycle isn’t happy, so be prepared 
					to apply a little calming muscle to maintain course. Ease 
					back the throttle, brake gingerly with the good wheel and 
					pull over very smoothly to the shoulder. Big sigh.</span> 
						</li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Drops on the faceshield?</b><br>It’s raining. Lightly misted pavement can be slipperier than 
					when it’s been rinsed by a downpour, and you never know how 
					much grip there is. Apply maximum-level concentration, 
					caution and smoothness.</span> </li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Leave the iPod at home</b><br>You won’t hear that cement truck in time with Spinal Tap 
					cranked to 11, but they might like your headphones in 
					intensive care.</span> </li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Learn to swerve</b><br>Be able to do two tight turns in quick succession. Flick 
					left around the bag of briquettes, then right back to your 
					original trajectory. The bike will follow your eyes, so look 
					at the way around, not the briquettes. Now practice till 
					it’s a reflex.</span> </li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Flashing is good for you</b><br>Turn signals get your attention by flashing, right? So a few 
					easy taps on the pedal or lever before stopping makes your 
					brake light more eye-catching to trailing traffic.</span> 
						</li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>All alone at a light that won’t 
					turn green?</b><br>Put as much motorcycle as possible directly above the sensor 
					wire—usually buried in the pavement beneath you and located 
					by a round or square pattern behind the limit line. If the 
					light still won’t change, try putting your kickstand down, 
					right on the wire. You should be on your way in seconds.</span>
						</li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Every-thing is harder to see 
					after dark</b><br>Adjust your headlights, Carry a clear faceshield and have 
					your game all the way on after dark, especially during 
					commuter hours. </span></li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Don’t troll next to—or right 
					behind—Mr. Peterbilt</b><br>If one of those 18 retreads blows up—which they do with some 
					regularity—it de-treads, and that can be ugly. Unless you 
					like dodging huge chunks of flying rubber, keep your 
					distance.</span> </li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Beware of tuner cars</b><br>They’re quick and their drivers tend to be aggressive. Don’t 
					assume you’ve beaten one away from a light or outpaced it in 
					traffic and change lanes without looking. You could end up 
					as a Nissan hood ornament.</span> </li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Don’t trust that deer whistle</b><br>Ungulates and other feral beasts prowl at dawn and dusk, so 
					heed those big yellow signs. If you’re riding in a 
					target-rich environment, slow down and watch the shoulders.</span> 
						</li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Make your tires right</b><br>None of this stuff matters unless your skins are right. 
					Don’t take ’em for granted. Make sure pressure is spot-on 
					every time you ride. Check for cuts, nails and other junk 
					they might have picked up, as well as general wear.</span> 
						</li>
						<li><span class="normal"><b>Take a deep breath</b><br>Count to 10. Visualize whirled peas. Forgetting some clown’s 
					80-mph indiscretion beats running the risk of ruining your 
					life, or ending it</span> </li>
						</ol>
